## 🌿 The Three Rules

1. **Wholefoods** 🥝🥜🍎  
   Keep skins, peels, shells, and natural barriers intact until the moment you eat.  

2. **Eat immediately** ⏱️🍴  
   Avoid leftovers or pre-prepared foods that sit at room temperature.  

3. **Cook if you can** 🔥🥩🍚  
   Heat kills most harmful bacteria, parasites, and viruses.  

**Mnemonic Visual:** 🍎 → 🔥 → 😋

- Boil or filter water before drinking 💧  
- Wash hands before handling food 🖐️  
- Use nasal or hand hygiene routines 👃👐  
- Store foods properly (cool, dry, airtight) ❄️
