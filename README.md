# Wholefood-Cook-Eat Shield 🍎🔥😋

A simple, effective mantra to reduce hidden microbial and toxin risks in everyday life.  
A fun but useful README that make you think about (food) safety

## 🌿 The Three Rules

1. **Wholefoods** 🥝🥜🍎  
   Keep skins, peels, shells, and natural barriers intact until the moment you eat.  

2. **Eat immediately** ⏱️🍴  
   Avoid leftovers or pre-prepared foods that sit at room temperature.  

3. **Cook if you can** 🔥🥩🍚  
   Heat kills most harmful bacteria, parasites, and viruses.  

**Mnemonic Visual:** 🍎 → 🔥 → 😋

## 💡 Extra habits
- Boil or filter water before drinking 💧  
- Wash hands before handling food 🖐️  
- Use nasal or hand hygiene routines 👃👐  
- Store foods properly (cool, dry, airtight) ❄️

## EXTRA: ⚠️ Understanding Botulism (Safe Overview)

Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by the **botulinum toxin**, produced by the bacteria *Clostridium botulinum*.  
The toxin is extremely potent at the biological level, which is why even very small amounts in contaminated food can be dangerous.

### 🧠 Why it’s serious
Botulinum toxin affects the nervous system and can cause:
- Muscle weakness
- Difficulty breathing
- Paralysis (in severe cases)

Because of its potency, botulism is treated as a **medical emergency**.

### 🍲 Where the risk comes from
Botulism risk is almost always linked to:
- **Bulging, damaged, or improperly processed canned foods**
- **Home-canned foods that were not pressure-canned**
- **Honey given to infants under 12 months**

These are the main real-world sources.

### 👶 Why infants are vulnerable
Infants have an immature gut microbiome.  
Spores from honey can grow and produce toxin in their intestines.  
Adults and older children usually destroy the spores with stomach acid.

### ✅ Practical safety tips
- Avoid eating from **bulging, dented, or rusted cans**
- Do not taste food if the can looks suspicious  
- Throw away any canned food that sprays or foams when opened  
- **Never** give honey to babies under 1 year  
- Refrigerate canned leftovers immediately and eat quickly  
- Follow the “Wholefood → Cook → Eat” mantra for extra safety

### 🟢 Actual risk level
Botulism is **very rare** in modern countries thanks to strict food processing standards.  
Following normal food safety practices makes the risk **extremely low**.
