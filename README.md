## 🌿 The Three Rules

1. **Wholefoods**
   
   Keep skins, peels, shells, and natural barriers intact until the moment you eat.  

3. **Eat immediately**
   
   Avoid leftovers or pre-prepared foods that sit at room temperature.  

4. **Cook if you can**
   
   Heat kills most harmful bacteria, parasites, and viruses.  

**Mnemonic Visual:** 🍎 → 🔥 → 😋

## 👶🧓 Special Considerations for Infants & Elderly

Some foods carry higher risks for people with **weaker immune systems**, including **infants under 1 year** and **elderly adults**. Follow these guidelines:

### High-Risk Foods for Infants
- 🍯 **Honey** - can contain spores that infants cannot safely process  
- 🌽 **Corn syrup** - same reason as honey  
- 🥚 **Raw or undercooked eggs**  
- 🥛 **Raw milk or soft cheeses made from raw milk**  
- 🧀 **Soft Cheeses** - like brie!
- 🌱 **Raw Sprouts**
    
### High-Risk Foods for Elderly
- 🥩 **Undercooked meats** - risk of *Listeria*, *Salmonella*  
- 🍲 **Leftovers not eaten immediately** - bacteria multiply quickly  
- 🥬 **Leafy greens and pre-cut vegetables** - can harbor *E. coli* or *Listeria*  
- 🍚 **Cooked rice stored too long** - *Bacillus cereus* spores  
- 🍲 **Canned food** - avoid dented, bulging, or damaged cans  
- 🧀 **Soft Cheeses** - like brie!
- 🌱 **Raw Sprouts**

### General Advice
- Follow the **Wholefood → Cook → Eat immediately** mantra  
- Wash hands, wash produce, boil/filter water if unsure  
- Store food properly (cool, dry, airtight)  


### ✅ Summary
- **Whole → Cook → Eat immediately** covers most microbial and toxin risks.  
- Extra hygiene habits (hands, water, nasal care) give additional protection.  
- This visual GitHub version is **easy to scan and expand** - new foods or risks can be added in collapsible sections.
